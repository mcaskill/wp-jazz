# Contributing to Jazz

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the Jazz repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **master** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [Neutron][phpcs-neutron-standard] and [WordPress][phpcs-wordpress-standard] coding standards.
